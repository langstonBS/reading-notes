## Domain Modeling
From the Duckett HTML book:

1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
1. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
1. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
1. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
1. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
1. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
