## Architectural Patterns VS Design Pattern
- design Patterns impact a specific section of the code base,-Architectural Patterns are high-level strategies that concern large-scale components, the global properties and mechanisms of a system.

### styles vs patterns 
- Architectural Style is a name given to a recurrent Architectural Design
- Architectural paterns exsist to solve a propblem

### partern type
#### layerd
- Presentation layer or UI layer
- Application layer or Service layer
- Business logic layer or Domain layer
- Data access layer or Persistence layer

- One major advantage of this pattern is the separation of concerns. It means that each layer focuses only on its role.

#### Event-Driven
- Also called EDA, this pattern organizes a system around the production, detection and consumption of events.

### Domain Driven Design
- Domain Driven Design is useful when we build complex software where the need for change is determined. We have to be careful and remember that DDD is not about how to code, but it is a way of looking at things.
- object-oriented approach. Here, the idea is to design software based on the Business Domain, its elements and behaviors, and the relationships between them.
### reusable elements
### Microservices small elemnets

## Container and Presentation Pattern
#### Containers
- Container components “[a]re concerned with how things work”1. In this role they manage state, fetch data from APIs, setup event handlers, and pass information to other components via props.

#### Presentations
- Presentation components “[a]re concerned with how things look”1. In this role they receive props and use those props to render and style DOM.

## Functional vs Class-Components in React
### Functional
- its hard to see why one is beter or more usefull then the other one
