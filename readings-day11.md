## BCrypt

- Using a Key Factor, BCrypt is able to adjust the cost of hashing. With Key Factor changes, the hash output can be influenced. In this way, BCrypt remains extremely resistant to hacks, especially a type of password cracking called rainbow table.

-  linux bases system
- Users may be fine waiting for 1 or 2 seconds as they don't have to consistently authenticate. The process could still be perceived as quick. Whereas, this delay would frustrate the efforts of an attacker to quickly compute a rainbow table.

- Auth0 helps you prevent critical identity data from falling into the wrong hands. We never store passwords in cleartext. Passwords are always hashed and salted using bcrypt. Both data at rest and in motion is encrypted

### Token Storage
-  You'll need to ensure that tokens and other sensitive data are not vulnerable to cross-site scripting
