## Model–view–controller

### Model
- The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface.[5] It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.
### View
- Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.
### Controller
- Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
