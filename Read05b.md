## problem solving

### Introduction
- cretive problem salving is needed to learn and be a good team membrer
- be open midned
-  Great new ideas often come from challenging our assumptions about how things do or should work. Always be open to different opinions. I'm not saying you have to agree with them but you should take the time to appreciate and understand them.
- be inqisitive 
- Always be looking around and noticing things. Try and notice everything, not just what is (or what you think is) directly related to the problem area. Often, things which you don't suspect have anything to do with what you are looking at actually do.

- Ask the Right Questions
- What is it actually doing?
- How is it actually doing it?
- How effectively is it performing its purpose?
- Why is it doing it/ what would happen if it was taken out?
- What is it's relationship with other components?
- What could I do to test that assumption

- slowdown
- Another approach to help slow things down is to come back to a problem. Leave it for a day or two (or an hour or two) and come back to it. You'll be surprised how much of a difference it can make.
